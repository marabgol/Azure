Thanks for watching Version Control for Everyone!

The video on using the Exercise Files covers most of what you need to know, but to amplify a couple things:

- Chapter 3 is meant to be followed along from start to finish, using the ddev-docs folder as your work-in-progress folder.  The individual videos folders contain additional files that are needed as you go, and a copy of the files as begun (Chapter 3, video 1), and as finished (Chapter 3, video 7).

- Some of the folders are already set up as git repositories, some are not.  If you're following along, and there's no included repository, just create it yourself the same way we do in Chapters 2 and 3.

- Chapter 5 uses two GitHub accounts for demonstration purposes.  If you want to try exactly what you see in the videos, you'll need to create your own GitHub accounts.  The goal was to show you how the workflow operates, but of course in the real world you'll be collaborating with another person, so you only need one account.  If you'd really like to copy everything exactly, feel free, but you will need two separate accounts to do it.
